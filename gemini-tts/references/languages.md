## How Language Works in Gemini TTS

- The TTS model **auto-detects** input language — no explicit language parameter is needed.
- Simply write the text in the desired language, and the model speaks it in that language.
- For accent or pronunciation control, include instructions in `style_prompt`.

## Practical Language Workflow

### Standard Workflow
1. Write the narration text in the target language.
2. Call `generate_speech(text=<text_in_target_language>)`.
3. The model auto-detects and speaks in that language.

### When Accent / Pronunciation Matters
Add language and accent guidance in `style_prompt`:
```python
generate_speech(
    text="Bienvenue à notre présentation.",
    voice_name="Kore",
    style_prompt="Speak in French with a standard Parisian accent. Clear, professional tone."
)
```
Generate a short pilot sample first (one sentence), then use `inspect_asset(...)` to QA pronunciation before generating the full script.

### Handling Proper Nouns and Tricky Words
- Add pronunciation hints in `style_prompt`:
  ```
  Pronounce "Nguyen" as "win". Say "PyTorch" as "pie-torch".
  ```
- If mispronunciation persists, try phonetic spelling in the text itself.
- Split lines with difficult words into shorter chunks for better control.

### Mixed-Language Content
- The model handles mixed-language text (e.g., English with French phrases) reasonably well.
- For best results, keep each chunk predominantly in one language.
- If switching languages mid-sentence is needed, include explicit guidance in `style_prompt`.

### Languages Not in the List
- Try it anyway — generate a short sample and QA it.
- The model may partially support unlisted languages.
- If quality is poor, suggest a nearby/related language instead.
