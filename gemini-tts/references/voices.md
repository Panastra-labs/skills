## Multi-Speaker Voice Pairing Tips

When using two speakers, pick voices with contrasting tones for clarity:

| Speaker Role | Good Pairings |
|-------------|---------------|
| Host + Guest | Kore + Puck, Charon + Sulafat |
| Interviewer + Expert | Achird + Sadaltager, Schedar + Gacrux |
| Narrator + Character | Rasalgethi + Fenrir, Sulafat + Algenib |
| Two friends chatting | Zubenelgenubi + Callirrhoe, Puck + Aoede |
| Serious + Light | Alnilam + Laomedeia, Gacrux + Zephyr |

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Keep the same voice across all chunks of one speaker's narration. Switching voices mid-narration is jarring.
- **Pilot first**: Generate a short test line (5–10 words) before committing to a voice for a full script. This validates the tone and feel.
- **Match voice to style_prompt**: A voice labeled "Firm" responds better to serious delivery prompts. An "Upbeat" voice responds better to energetic prompts. Mismatched voice + style can produce odd results.
- **Pair voice with content**: Consider the subject matter. A gravelly voice (Algenib) for a children's story is likely wrong. A soft voice (Achernar) for a sports highlight reel is likely wrong.
